# @pacto/k8s-module

## 5.1.2

### Patch Changes

- bbc7b9c: Rebuild the operator and dashboard container images through the new native per-arch
  build pipeline: each architecture builds on its own runner (no QEMU emulation) and is
  merged into the multi-arch manifest. No functional change to the engine, operator, or
  dashboard — this release ships and validates the faster image pipeline.

## 5.1.1

### Patch Changes

- dd4dab1: Repo-wide audit remediation (engine, CLI, dashboard). Closes the OpenAPI
  breaking-change diff false-negatives — path-item-level parameters are now diffed,
  the request body is deep-diffed so a newly required property is BREAKING, and
  optional→required / added-required parameters are BREAKING — so a BREAKING-only
  release gate can no longer be bypassed. Further security and dashboard fixes land
  in the same PR.

  As the first release since v3.1.0, this also ships the previously-merged but
  unreleased dashboard **Ctrl+C shutdown fix** and the demo version-label fix.

## 5.1.0

### Minor Changes

- b58778a: Unify all published OCI artifacts under the monorepo `ghcr.io/trianalab/pacto/*` namespace.

  - operator image → `ghcr.io/trianalab/pacto/operator`
  - operator chart → `ghcr.io/trianalab/pacto/charts/pacto-operator`
  - dashboard image → `ghcr.io/trianalab/pacto/dashboard`
  - dashboard contract bundle → `ghcr.io/trianalab/pacto/dashboard-contract`
  - demo bundles already live under `ghcr.io/trianalab/pacto/*`

  All packages are now created and owned by this repository. The chart name
  `pacto-operator` and the Artifact Hub repository are preserved (re-point the AH
  repository URL to the new chart coordinate). The previous coordinates remain as
  historical — their already-published versions are unaffected. Go module paths
  (`/v3`, `/v5`) are unchanged.

## 5.0.0

### Major Changes

- 045f11e: The Kubernetes integration moves into the monorepo — breaking for consumers.

  - The Go module path becomes `github.com/trianalab/pacto/integrations/kubernetes/v5`
    (was `github.com/trianalab/pacto-operator`).
  - It pins the published core module `github.com/trianalab/pacto/v3` at release
    time; the `go.work` workspace resolution is development-only.
  - The integration continues the operator `v4` line as `v5` (image + chart +
    module); public OCI/chart coordinates are preserved.
