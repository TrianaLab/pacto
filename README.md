# Pacto

**A single YAML contract that describes how a cloud-native service behaves — validated, versioned, and distributed as an OCI artifact.**

Pacto (/ˈpak.to/ — Spanish for *pact*) captures everything a platform needs to know about a service — interfaces, runtime behavior, dependencies, configuration, and scaling — in one file that machines can validate and tooling can consume.

**[Documentation](https://trianalab.github.io/pacto)** · **[Quickstart](https://trianalab.github.io/pacto/quickstart)** · **[Specification](https://trianalab.github.io/pacto/contract-reference)** · **[Examples](https://trianalab.github.io/pacto/examples)**

---

## How it works — 30-second overview

```
1. Developer writes a pacto.yaml alongside their code
2. pacto validate checks it (structure, cross-references, semantics)
3. pacto push ships the contract to an OCI registry as a versioned artifact
4. Platform tooling pulls the contract and uses it to generate manifests,
   enforce policies, resolve dependency graphs, or detect breaking changes
```

No runtime agents. No sidecars. No new infrastructure. Pacto is a **build-time and CI-time tool** — it produces a validated, immutable description of your service that platforms and pipelines can consume downstream.

---

## The problem

Today, a cloud service is described across **six different places** — none of which talk to each other:

```
OpenAPI spec    → describes the API, but not the runtime
Helm values     → describes deployment, but not the service
env vars        → documented in a wiki (maybe), validated never
K8s manifests   → hardcoded ports, guessed health checks
Dependencies    → tribal knowledge in Slack threads
README.md       → outdated the day it was written
```

The consequences:

- **Platforms guess service behavior.** Is it stateful? What port? Does it need persistent storage?
- **Dev ↔ Platform friction.** Developers ship code; platform engineers reverse-engineer how to run it.
- **Breaking changes detected too late.** A port change or removed dependency breaks production, not CI.
- **Documentation drifts from reality.** No one updates six files when one thing changes.

## Who is this for?

- **Application developers** — Describe your service once. Validation catches misconfigurations before CI. Breaking changes are detected automatically across versions.
- **Platform engineers** — Consume contracts to generate manifests, enforce policies, and visualize dependency graphs. No more reverse-engineering how to run a service.
- **DevOps / infrastructure teams** — Distribute contracts through existing OCI registries. Integrate with CI pipelines using standard tooling — no new infrastructure required.

## What Pacto captures

One file. Machine-validated. Versioned and distributed as an OCI artifact.

```yaml
pactoVersion: "1.0"

service:
  name: payments-api
  version: 2.1.0
  owner: team/payments

interfaces:
  - name: rest-api
    type: http
    port: 8080
    visibility: public
    contract: interfaces/openapi.yaml
  - name: grpc-internal
    type: grpc
    port: 9090
    visibility: internal

dependencies:
  - ref: oci://ghcr.io/acme/auth-pacto@sha256:abc123
    required: true
    compatibility: "^2.0.0"

runtime:
  workload: service
  state:
    type: stateful
    persistence:
      scope: local
      durability: persistent
    dataCriticality: high
  health:
    interface: rest-api
    path: /health

scaling:
  min: 2
  max: 10
```

Only `pactoVersion` and `service` are required — everything else is opt-in, so a contract can be as minimal or as detailed as your service needs.

Platforms, CI, and tooling can now reason about the service automatically — no guessing, no wiki diving, no Slack archaeology.

## What's inside a Pacto bundle

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Bundle["Pacto Bundle"]
        YAML["pacto.yaml"]
        YAML --> Interfaces["Interfaces<br/>HTTP, gRPC, ports, visibility"]
        YAML --> Dependencies["Dependencies<br/>oci://auth:2.0.0<br/>oci://db:1.0.0"]
        YAML --> Runtime["Runtime<br/>state, health, lifecycle, scaling"]
        YAML --> Config["Configuration<br/>JSON Schema"]
    end

    IF["interfaces/<br/>openapi.yaml · service.proto"]
    CF["configuration/<br/>schema.json"]

    Interfaces -.-> IF
    Config -.-> CF
    Bundle -- "pacto push" --> Registry["OCI Registry<br/>GHCR · ECR · ACR · Docker Hub"]
```

A bundle is a self-contained directory (or OCI artifact) containing:

- **`pacto.yaml`** — the contract: interfaces, dependencies, runtime semantics, scaling
- **`interfaces/`** — OpenAPI specs, protobuf definitions, event schemas
- **`configuration/`** — JSON Schema for environment variables and settings

## Example repository layout

A typical service repository using Pacto looks like this:

```
payments-api/
  src/                           ← your application code
  Dockerfile
  pacto.yaml                     ← the contract (committed to the repo)
  interfaces/
    openapi.yaml                 ← referenced by pacto.yaml
  configuration/
    schema.json                  ← JSON Schema for env vars / config
  .github/workflows/
    ci.yml                       ← pacto validate + pacto diff + pacto push
```

The contract lives next to the code it describes. CI validates it on every push and publishes it to an OCI registry on release.

---

## Key capabilities

- **3-layer validation** — structural (YAML schema), cross-field (port references, interface names), and semantic (state vs. persistence consistency)
- **Dependency graph resolution** — recursively resolve transitive dependencies from OCI registries. Sibling deps are fetched in parallel
- **Breaking change detection** — `pacto diff` compares two contract versions field-by-field *and* resolves both dependency trees to show the full blast radius
- **OCI distribution** — push/pull contracts to any OCI registry (GHCR, ECR, ACR, Docker Hub, Harbor). Bundles are cached locally for fast repeated operations
- **Rich documentation** — `pacto doc` generates Markdown with architecture diagrams, interface tables, and configuration details from the contract itself

---

## CLI demo

```bash
# Scaffold a new contract
$ pacto init payments-api
Created payments-api/
  payments-api/pacto.yaml
  payments-api/interfaces/
  payments-api/configuration/

# Validate (3-layer: structural → cross-field → semantic)
$ pacto validate payments-api
payments-api is valid

# Push to any OCI registry
$ pacto push oci://ghcr.io/acme/payments-api-pacto -p payments-api
Pushed payments-api@1.0.0 -> ghcr.io/acme/payments-api-pacto:1.0.0
Digest: sha256:a1b2c3d4...

# Visualize the dependency tree
$ pacto graph payments-api
payments-api@2.1.0
├─ auth-service@2.3.0
│  └─ user-store@1.0.0
└─ postgres@16.0.0

# Generate documentation with architecture diagrams
$ pacto doc payments-api --serve

# Detect breaking changes — including dependency graph shifts
$ pacto diff oci://ghcr.io/acme/payments-api-pacto:1.0.0 \
             oci://ghcr.io/acme/payments-api-pacto:2.0.0
Classification: BREAKING
Changes (4):
  [BREAKING] runtime.state.type (modified): runtime.state.type modified
  [BREAKING] runtime.state.persistence.durability (modified): runtime.state.persistence.durability modified
  [BREAKING] interfaces (removed): interfaces removed
  [BREAKING] dependencies (removed): dependencies removed

Dependency graph changes:
payments-api
├─ auth-service  1.5.0 → 2.3.0
└─ postgres      -16.0.0
```

`pacto diff` doesn't just compare fields — it resolves both dependency trees and shows exactly what shifted: version upgrades, added services, and removed dependencies. One command, full blast-radius visibility.

---

## Why OCI?

Pacto bundles are distributed as **OCI artifacts** — the same standard behind Docker images. This means:

- **Versioned and immutable** — every contract is content-addressed with a digest
- **Works with existing registries** — GHCR, ECR, ACR, Docker Hub, Harbor — no new infrastructure
- **Signable and scannable** — use cosign, Notary, or any OCI-compatible signing tool
- **Pull from CI, platforms, or scripts** — standard tooling, no proprietary clients

---

## How Pacto compares

Pacto doesn't replace these tools — it fills the gap between them.

| Concern | OpenAPI | Helm | Terraform | Backstage | Pacto |
|---------|---------|------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| API contract | ✅ | — | — | — | ✅ |
| Runtime semantics (state, health, lifecycle) | — | Partial | — | — | ✅ |
| Typed dependencies with version constraints | — | — | — | — | ✅ |
| Configuration schema | — | Partial | — | — | ✅ |
| Breaking change detection | — | — | — | — | ✅ |
| Dependency graph resolution + diff | — | — | — | — | ✅ |
| OCI-native distribution | — | ✅ | — | — | ✅ |
| Machine validation | ✅ | — | ✅ | — | ✅ |

**Why not just OpenAPI + Helm?** OpenAPI describes your API surface. Helm describes how to deploy one particular way. Neither captures runtime behavior (stateful vs. stateless), dependency relationships, configuration schemas, or scaling intent — and there's no way to diff two versions across all of these dimensions. Pacto is the layer that ties them together.

## What Pacto is NOT

- **Not a deployment tool.** Pacto doesn't deploy anything. It describes *what* a service is — platforms decide *how* to run it.
- **Not a service mesh or runtime agent.** There's nothing to install in your cluster. Pacto runs at build time and CI time only.
- **Not a service catalog.** Pacto produces the structured data that a catalog (Backstage, Port, Cortex) could consume, but it's not a UI or portal.
- **Not a replacement for OpenAPI or Helm.** It references your OpenAPI specs and complements deployment tools — it doesn't replace them.

---

## Ecosystem vision

Pacto contracts are designed to be consumed by any tool in your stack:

- **CI pipelines** — validate contracts on every PR, diff against the published version to catch breaking changes, push on release
- **Platform controllers** — pull contracts from the registry to generate Kubernetes manifests, Terraform modules, or Helm values automatically
- **Service catalogs** — import contract metadata (owner, interfaces, dependencies) into Backstage, Port, or internal dashboards
- **Policy engines** — enforce organizational rules (e.g., "all public services must have a health check") against the contract before deployment

The contract is the API between developers and the platform. Pacto provides the format, the validation, and the distribution — what you build on top is up to you.
